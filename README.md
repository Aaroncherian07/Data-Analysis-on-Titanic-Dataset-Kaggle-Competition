## Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset

This repository works on the Titanic Dataset available in Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic). This repository contains an analysis of the Titanic dataset available on Kaggle. The dataset provides information about the passengers aboard the Titanic, including their demographics, ticket details, cabin information, and survival status. The goal of this analysis is to explore the dataset and build predictive models to determine factors that influenced passenger survival.

Analysis Overview:

Data Exploration: The dataset will be explored to gain insights into the available features, identify missing values, and understand the distribution of variables. Visualizations will be used to analyze relationships between variables.

Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning techniques will be applied to handle missing values and outliers. Feature engineering may be performed to create new variables or extract meaningful information from existing ones.

Feature Selection: Relevant features will be selected for model building. Statistical methods and domain knowledge will be used to identify the most informative variables.

Model Building: Different machine learning algorithms will be employed to build predictive models. This may include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or other appropriate classifiers. Cross-validation techniques will be used to estimate model performance.

Model Evaluation: The trained models will be evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The models will be compared to determine the most effective approach for predicting passenger survival.

Documentation: The analysis process, including data preprocessing steps, model building techniques, and evaluation results, will be documented in the Jupyter Notebook (titanic.ipynb).
